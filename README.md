## Installation
First of all you need `python` which you can install in [this website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After that you just follow the instructions, but make sure to tick "Add to PATH".

Then download this repo using [this link](https://github.com/iSimpp/MODS/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip it and then follow the How To Use part.


## How to Use:
To add different Mod Folders, just go into: ``%Appdata%\Mods`` and create folders, then go into your cmd, and execute addmods.py with the arguments being: `addmods.py <link to the .jar file> <name you want it to save as>`

Then to change directories you should run `addversion.py` it will open a GUI and then you can select which Folder of Mod/s you want it to run.
